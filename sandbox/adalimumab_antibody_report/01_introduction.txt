This report contains a structure and sequence-based analysis of the antibody "Adalimumab". The supplied light and heavy chain sequence variable regions (shown below) have approximate molecular weights of 11665.1 and 13226.7 respectively. Most of the analyses featured in this report are computed using the data from the antibody variable regions. If a 3D structure of the antibody is also available, the solvent-accessible surface analysis is performed for the entire structure.
